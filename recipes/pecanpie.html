    <h1>Pecan Pie</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pecan pie is one of my personal favourites-it is such a treat to bite into that chewy, buttery perfection at the end of a Thanksgiving meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baking-basics-homemade-buttery-flaky-pie-crust/">For the crust </a></h3>
    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 stick unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups pecan halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 with a baking sheet on middle rack.</li>
        <li>Roll out pie dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edge, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold overhang under and lightly press against rim of pie plate, then crimp decoratively. Lightly prick bottom all over with a fork. Chill until firm, at least 30 minutes (or freeze 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add brown sugar, whisking until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in corn syrup, vanilla, zest, and salt. Lightly beat eggs in a medium bowl, then whisk in corn syrup mixture.</li>
        <li>Put pecans in unbaked pie shell and pour corn syrup mixture evenly over them. Bake on hot baking sheet until filling is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
